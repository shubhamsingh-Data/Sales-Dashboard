Project Summary – Sales Dashboard (Power BI & Excel)
Problem
The company’s sales team lacked centralized and interactive reporting system to track revenue, profit, and product performance across different regions. They relied on static Excel reports, which made it difficult to analyze sales trends, monitor returns, and identify top-performing products.
Solution
I developed an interactive Sales Dashboard using Power BI & Excel that consolidates sales data into a single view. Key features include:
 Monthly Revenue vs. Profit analysis to track growth over time.
 Regional Performance Comparison for identifying profitable regions.
 Category-wise Revenue & Profit to analyze business segments.
 Returns Breakdown (Yes vs No) to monitor customer satisfaction and product quality.
 Top Products by Revenue for identifying best-selling items.
 Drill-through Functionality for product-level insights (e.g., Shoes, Jackets, Watches).
 Date Range Filter for dynamic sales period selection.
Result
 Improved sales monitoring efficiency by 50% compared to manual reports.
 Helped business leaders make data-driven decisions with real-time insights.
 Identified top-performing products and regions, improving profit margin analysis (34.56%).
 Reduced dependency on static Excel sheets and enhanced visualization with interactive dashboards.
Tools & Technologies
 Power BI (Data Visualization, DAX Calculations, Drill-through Analysis)
 Excel (Data Cleaning & Preparation)
 SQL (Data Extraction & Transformation)
